The war has resulted in thousands of deaths and displacement of millions of people.

Efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict have been unsuccessful.\",\n",

Left-wing commentators often criticize the Russian government for its interference in Ukrainian internal affairs and its support for separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine. They also argue for the provision of military aid to the Ukrainian government and support for international sanctions against Russia. Additionally, left-wing commentators often express solidarity with the Ukrainian people and their struggle for democracy and self-determination.\",\n",

Right-wing commentators often criticize the Ukrainian government for its corruption, incompetence, and inability to deal with the separatist movements. They also argue for a hardline approach towards Russia, including the provision of military aid to Ukraine, the strengthening of NATO, and the imposition of harsher sanctions against Russia.
