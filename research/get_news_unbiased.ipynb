This can include words or phrases that convey a particular viewpoint or judgment without presenting balanced information.\\nSelective reporting: Choosing to report only certain aspects of a story while ignoring others that may provide context or alternative viewpoints. This can lead to a skewed representation of events.\\nOmission of key information: Intentionally leaving out relevant facts or details that may contradict or weaken the narrative being presented. This can result in a one-sided portrayal of issues.\\nSource selection: Relying heavily on sources that align with a particular political ideology or agenda, while marginalizing or ignoring dissenting voices. This can create a perception of bias by presenting a limited range of perspectives.\\nFraming: Presenting information in a way that emphasizes one interpretation over others. This can involve highlighting certain aspects of a story while downplaying or minimizing others, influencing how readers perceive the issue.\\nSensationalism: Prioritizing sensational or attention-grabbing stories over more substantive or nuanced coverage. This can lead to exaggerated or misleading portrayals of events.\\nMisrepresentation: Distorting facts or events to fit a particular narrative or agenda. This can involve cherry-picking data, misquoting sources, or presenting information out of context.\\nBiased headlines: Crafting headlines that convey a particular viewpoint or interpretation of a story before readers have had a chance to assess the content. This can influence readers' perceptions before they've read the article.\\nOpinion masquerading as news: Blurring the line between opinion and factual reporting by interjecting personal bias or commentary into news articles. This can lead to a lack of objectivity in reporting.\\nConsistency of bias: Patterns of consistently favoring one political viewpoint or party over others in news coverage, over time. This can indicate systemic bias within a news organization.\""
